        Here we will learn more about what you want from your website and get an
        idea of how much content will be on your website. After we get a good
        understanding of how your website is going to look we will give you the
        project timeline and breakdown the cost of it as well.

        Starting here we will take care of almost everything. We will create a
        initial design for you and once that design is created we will get your
        input and see what needs to be changed. Once we have a design that you
        are happy with we will sign the contract and start writing the code for
        the website.

        This is where we write all the code and create your website based off
        the design that you approved of. We use the latest technology such as
        TypeScript and React to develop your website. We make sure that the code
        we write is clean and efficient in order to give users a better
        experience and also improve your websiteâ€™s SEO.

        continues to rank higher. You can also have us update parts of the
        website whether it be uploading new images or changing the content.
